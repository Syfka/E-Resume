            <h2>Luncai Emas Sdn Bhd</h2>
            <p>As an Administrative Assistant at Luncai Emas, I played a vital role in ensuring smooth office operations and supporting the team in achieving company goals.
                 My responsibilities included managing daily administrative tasks, maintaining accurate records, and coordinating communication across departments.
                 I streamlined office workflows by organizing schedules, handling correspondence, and implementing an efficient filing system. 
                 Additionally, I managed data entry, prepared reports, and assisted with financial tasks such as processing invoices and tracking expenses. 
                 My role required strong organizational and problem-solving skills to address operational challenges and adapt to the fast-paced environment.
                 By maintaining attention to detail and fostering effective collaboration, I contributed to enhancing team productivity and supporting creative company initiatives.</p>
