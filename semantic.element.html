        <h3>Being your own best friend can also be a great way to work through feelings of loneliness,
        insecurity, and instability in your life. By cultivating a productive and positive self, you can learn
        to trust yourself consistently and turn inward to work on any issues or problems you may
        encounter. </h4>

            <p style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">
                Like we said before, most people have no earthly idea how to love themselves, or even like
                       themselves, because they can’t stand being alone. They would rather constantly escape
                       themselves than endure five minutes of sitting in silence with their own thoughts and feelings.
                       Many people spend their whole lives running away from themselves, just so they don’t have
                       to deal with what they find. However, uncovering both the darkness and light within will yield
                       beautiful new beginnings and discoveries about what you’re made of and who you are.
                       Once you start to become your own best friend, you will learn to treat yourself like you would
                       any other friend. You will also learn how to have a real relationship with yourself, and not
                       depend on others for love and attention.

        <h1 style="color: rgb(222, 151, 163);"><i>SOLITUDE WON’T SCARE YOU ANYMORE.</b> 
            <p style="background-color:rgb(84, 10, 10);">
                Many people feel afraid of the idea of spending time alone, but it shouldn’t scare you; in fact,
                        it should liberate you. You don’t have to answer to anyone else or try to explain yourself to
                        others; you can just BE, and take in the joy of simply being alive. In solitude, you can find out
                        more about yourself, and do things on your own clock. If you want to spend hours in nature,
                        go do that. If you want to spend time gardening, drawing, or coloring, go do it. Spending time
                        alone means learning what you like and don’t like, which will help you uncover more truths
                        about yourself and peel back those layers you have on your soul.

                <p style="background-color:rgb(222, 184, 222);">
                    Once you become your own best friend, you will magically see all the other relationships in
                            your life improve. You will no longer have disconnected or strained relationships, because you
                            will have started to mend everything disjointed and distant within yourself. If you want better,
                            more meaningful relationships in your life, you must first learn how to be your best friend and
                            love yourself no matter what. Do this, and you will have blossoming, wonderful relationships
                            with others that seem effortless rather than exhausting.

                OWN HAPPINESS.</b>
                <p style="background-color:rgb(233, 129, 111);">
                    As you make a best friend out of yourself, it will become clear that nothing outside you should
                           regulate your happiness. You hold the reigns, and you can gallop through the most beautiful
                           field of wildflowers, or into the darkest, stormiest night. You get to make the choice, and only
                           you can steer yourself toward a happier life. In becoming your own best friend, you will learn
                           what makes you happy, and start doing more of that! We can’t learn to create our own
                           happiness if we don’t take the time to explore ourselves and realize what brings our hearts the
                           most joy.

                <p style="background-color:rgb(31, 2, 41);">
                    Nothing feels better than freeing yourself from expectations and dependency on others. Simply
                            put, if you rely solely on other people for happiness, companionship, safety, or anything else,
                            you will have NOTHING when they leave. You must cultivate all of this within yourself and
                            truly realize that everything you need, you already have. You came to this Earth as a divinely
                            created, complete being, so nothing is lacking within you. This world might have you think you
                            need all these things outside yourself to feel happy, but don’t buy into that. You have it all, and
                            once you understand this and choose to live from a belief of abundance rather than scarcity
                            or inadequacy, you will have the best friend possible by your side: yourself.
